### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Daniel**, and I'm passionate about Open Source projects. You might occassionally find me dropping random pull requests on repositories that catch my interest.

Iâ€™m currently working at the [Senckenberg Society for Nature Research](https://www.senckenberg.de/en/), where I focus on making scientific outputs more open and [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

#### Connect ðŸ“«

You can find me on various platforms. If you want to get in touch, the easiest way is probably by [mail](https://dbauer.me/contact).
